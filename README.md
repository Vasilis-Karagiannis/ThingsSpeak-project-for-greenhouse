# Greenhouse control application using Thingspeak
In this project i present the code i've built to send 3 values for temperature, humidity and water pressure to Thingspeak and update the corresponding fields every 50 seconds. Also due to the fact that I didn't have a real micro selector to send the values in real, I have integrated the appropriate libraries so that random values are sent and I have added as simulation variables-sensors the Dht11 sensor for temperature, humidity and the Bmp280 sensor for water pressure.
