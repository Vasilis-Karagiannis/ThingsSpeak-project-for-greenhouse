# ThingsSpeak-project-for-greenhouse
In this project i present a greenhouse control application using Thingspeak without the support of a microcontroller such as Arduino or Raspberry other through the Virtual Studio Code environment. In the script, I list the code I have built so that it sends 3 values for temperature, humidity and water pressure to Thingspeak and updates the corresponding fields every 50 seconds. Also due to the fact that I didn't have a real microcontroller to send the values in real, I have integrated the appropriate libraries so that random values are sent and I have added as simulation variables-sensors the Dht11 sensor for temperature, humidity and the Bmp280 sensor for water pressure.
